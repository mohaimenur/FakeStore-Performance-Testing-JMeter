Dear, 

Iâ€™ve completed a performance test on frequently used API for FakeStoreAPI(https://fakestoreapi.com/). 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server 000.000.000.00. 

100 Concurrent Requests with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 105 And Total Concurrent API requested: 29000.
200 Concurrent Requests with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 103 And Total Concurrent API requested: 58000.
300 Concurrent Requests with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 112 And Total Concurrent API requested: 87000.

While executed 300 concurrent requests, found  9 requests got connection timeout and error rate is 0.01%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 85000 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.

Please find the details report from the attachment and let me know if you have any further queries.

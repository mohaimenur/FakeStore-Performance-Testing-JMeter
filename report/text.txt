How to extract data for reporting in jmeter
============================================
Dear, 

Iâ€™ve completed performance test on frequently used API for test App. 
Test executed for the below mentioned scenario in server 000.000.000.00. 

200 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 234 And Total Concurrent API requested: 1400.
300 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 350 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2100.
400 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 424 And Total Concurrent API requested: 2800.
500 Concurrent Request with 10 Loop Count; Avg TPS for Total Samples is ~ 443 And Total Concurrent API requested: 3500.

While executed 500 concurrent request, found  82 request got connection timeout and error rate is 0.23%. 

Summary: Server can handle almost concurrent 3200 API call with almost zero (0) error rate.

Please find the details report from the attachment and  let me know if you have any further queries.
